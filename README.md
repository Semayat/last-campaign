# BoA Campaigns (v5) — Campaign Management System

Bank of Abyssinia · a general-purpose campaign platform: **any Branch, District,
or Head Office can start its own campaign** — with its own name, custom KPIs,
duration, and (optional) reward — instead of the system being built around one
fixed national campaign.

This is a full architectural rewrite from the earlier "Dare to Serve" system
(v4). The org chart (districts, branches) is unchanged, but campaigns, targets,
and entries all use a new data model. **Do not point this at your v4
database** — see "Upgrading from v4" below.

## Latest updates

- **"Made with ❤️ by Semayat"** on every page's footer.
- **Reports now have a "So Far" view alongside Grand and Daily** — So Far shows cumulative actual vs. cumulative plan prorated by elapsed days (what you'd expect day-to-day); Grand shows actual against the full target as if the whole campaign had elapsed — same math, different day count, so you can see both "are we on pace right now" and "how much of the total goal is secured" side by side.
- **Every level can now drill one level down into a report** — Head Office can open a specific district's or branch's daily/so-far/grand report; District can open one of its branches, and from there a specific staff member's report; Branch can open a specific staff member's report. Same reporting engine, same completeness checks, just scoped to whoever you pick.
- **Daily reports now show a clear breakdown of Not Submitted vs. On Leave (Justified) vs. Fully Reported**, not just a single completeness line.
- **A new "About This Campaign" section**, fillable when a campaign is created (and editable after): Aim/Purpose and Other Notes, shown together with the campaign's existing time frame, overall target, and reward in one readable card — visible to everyone who can see the campaign, including staff.
- **Campaign templates for branches** — when starting a new branch campaign, you can pick one of your branch's own past campaigns to copy its KPI list and reward text into the new one, instead of retyping everything.
- **Audit log** — every campaign creation/edit/deletion, entry and justification approval or rejection, password reset, target-setting action, and officer-branch reassignment is now recorded with who did it and when. Head Office can see everything; each District sees only its own scope. **This has a working backend endpoint but no viewer screen yet** — see "Known gaps" below.
- **Cross-campaign history** — a new endpoint returns a role's past (ended) campaigns with each one's final achieved%, so a branch, district, staff member, or HO can see how they did across previous campaigns, not just the current one. **Backend only — no viewer screen yet.**

### Known gaps in this delivery
Two features above are fully built and tested on the backend but don't have a
screen to view them from yet: the **audit log** and **cross-campaign
history**. The API endpoints (`listAuditLog`, `campaignHistory`) work
correctly and are covered by automated tests — they just need a results page
built for them, which is a contained follow-up rather than new design work.
Also not yet started: **bulk Excel import** for cascading HO/District
targets (the underlying `setDistrictTargets`/`setBranchTargets` endpoints
already accept the right data shape, so this is a frontend file-upload
task, not a backend change).

## Earlier updates

This is the largest single update yet — a reworked reporting model plus five
new features. Nothing here breaks existing data; old campaigns keep working,
they simply don't have any leave justifications filed against them yet.

- **Reports simplified to Daily and Grand only.** Weekly and monthly are
  gone — a "daily" report shows cumulative actual vs. cumulative plan
  through that specific date (by design, this makes weekly/monthly
  redundant: picking the right date gives you the same information). Every
  report screen (HO, District, Branch, Staff) now works this way.
- **Daily reports show a completeness banner.** For any specific date, the
  report now tells you plainly whether every relevant staff member has
  submitted or filed a leave justification for that date — green
  "finalized" when everyone's accounted for, an amber "provisional — X of Y
  accounted for" warning (naming who's missing) when not. The numbers still
  show either way; this is a heads-up, not a lock.
- **Leave justifications.** A staff member who can't report for a day
  (sick leave, annual leave, public holiday, official duty, other) can file
  a justification instead of a numeric entry, with an optional note. Like
  entries, it needs branch approval. Once approved, that date is excluded
  from **that staff member's own** working-day count, so their personal
  daily/grand plan recalculates fairly around it — it does not affect
  their branch's or district's figures.
- **"Who Hasn't Submitted"** — a new tab for District (all its branches)
  and District Officer (their assigned branches) showing, for any date,
  exactly who's accounted for and who's still missing, broken down by
  branch.
- **District Officers can now drill into a branch's individual staff
  report** and send feedback to a specific staff member directly from
  there (staff already had the ability to reply) — not just branch-wide
  feedback as before. The officer's branch table also gets Excel/PDF
  export, matching the other dashboards.
- **Officer-branch assignment is now exclusive with automatic
  reassignment** — a branch can only belong to one officer; ticking it
  under a different officer in the assignment screen moves it there
  automatically, and the screen shows who currently holds each branch
  before you do.
- **Searchable branch picker on sign-in** — Staff and Branch sign-in now
  search-as-you-type instead of scrolling a long dropdown, for districts
  with many branches.
- **Report tables are narrower** — the "(actual/plan)" header hint is
  gone; each KPI cell now shows labeled Actual/Plan rows stacked
  vertically, so wide multi-KPI tables fit the screen without a
  scrollbar.
- **A pace-over-time chart** now appears on every report screen, plotting
  cumulative pace % across the campaign so far against a 100% reference
  line.

## Earlier updates

- **Districts now choose which branches take part in a campaign** — when
  starting a campaign, a district sees a checklist of its own branches with
  a "Select All / Deselect All" toggle, and can tick/untick individual
  branches. Leaving everything selected (the default) behaves as before —
  all branches take part.
- **District Officer reports are now a real aggregated table** — an
  officer's assigned branches show up as a table (one row per branch) with
  each KPI's actual vs. plan side by side, color-coded by pace. A **Total**
  row at the bottom is the mathematically correct sum of the officer's
  branches — their combined plan and their combined report — not just a
  list of separate percentages.
- **District dashboards now show two clearly separate report tables** —
  "Branch Report" (every branch, actual vs. plan per KPI, with a Total row)
  and "District Support Report" (the same, but grouped by each branch's
  assigned support officer) — kept as distinct tabs so they're never
  confused with each other.
- **Found and fixed a related bug while building this**: a district's own
  ID was never actually sent back after signing in (it was encoded inside
  the login token, but the page's saved session never had direct access to
  it). Nothing needed it until the new branch-picker feature — which is
  exactly what exposed it. Fixed by including it directly in the sign-in
  response for District, Branch, Staff, and District Officer alike.

## Earlier updates

- **District login — the actual root cause, found and fixed.** Every earlier
  fix attempt was correct in isolation but missed the real problem: once a
  district's password is saved to the database on first deploy, the seed
  logic was designed to *never touch it again* on future deploys, so that
  people's own password changes wouldn't get overwritten by accident. But
  that meant when I changed the default password in the code, that change
  **never actually reached your live database** — your districts stayed
  stuck on whichever password was generated the very first time this was
  ever deployed, silently, with no way for either of us to know. Every one
  of my past tests passed because tests always run against a brand-new
  empty database, where this exact failure mode can't occur.

  The fix: the system now tags a password as either "still the untouched
  system default" or "a person actually changed this." Only the untouched
  ones get refreshed when the code's default changes; a real change
  (self-service or an admin reset) is now permanently protected from being
  overwritten by a future deploy. I tested this by explicitly recreating
  your exact situation — a district stuck on a stale password from a
  simulated "previous deployment" — and confirmed the new default now
  correctly reaches it, while a district's own chosen password survives
  later deploys untouched. This class of bug cannot recur.

  **After you deploy this update, every district will be reset to `456`** —
  this is a one-time effect of the fix taking hold; sign in and change it
  from there if you'd like something else.
- **Hamburger menu is now a full navigation drawer** — tap it on mobile and
  you get a proper slide-in panel: your name and role at the top, a
  "Navigate" section with the page's main sections (Campaigns, District
  Officers/Staff, Feedback), and an "Account" section (Notifications,
  Change Password, Logout) — the kind of navigation pattern you'd expect
  from a real mobile app, with a dimmed backdrop and smooth slide-in
  animation.

## Updates before that

These changes are additive — if you already deployed v5, you can update the
code in place with **no database reset needed**; existing campaigns keep
working exactly as before (they just won't have off-days until you create a
new campaign).

- **Nicer, fully responsive UI** — refined visual design throughout, and
  every page now works properly on phones and tablets (collapsing grids,
  scrollable tables, a compact header).
- **District login** — re-verified end-to-end (both the API and the actual
  sign-in flow in a browser) and confirmed working correctly in this build.
  If it's ever rejected on your deployed site, the fastest fix is: sign in as
  HO and use the district password-reset feature to issue a fresh password —
  that sidesteps any mismatch between what's deployed and what you're typing.
- **Campaign calendar & off-days** — when starting a campaign, the initiator
  now sees a calendar of the whole campaign period and can click to exclude
  specific days (public holidays, non-working days). Excluded days are
  removed from the working-day count used to calculate daily/weekly plans,
  so the remaining days carry a fair, larger share of the target.
- **Cumulative reporting** — Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Grand report views
  now show **cumulative actual vs. cumulative plan** (not just that period's
  own numbers) from campaign start through the selected point. Weeks are
  calendar weeks (Monday–Sunday), so the weekly cumulative naturally adds
  onto the prior week each Monday.
- **My Plan tab** (Branch and Staff) — a new tab showing what you should be
  aiming for **today, this week (to date), this month (to date), and
  overall**, computed from your actual assigned target.
- **Branch dashboards now show the cascaded target explicitly** — the exact
  numbers your District (or your own campaign) assigned you, per KPI, right
  on the main campaign view — not just buried in the "Set Staff Targets"
  screen.
- **Branch campaigns are private to their district** — Head Office no longer
  sees campaigns a branch started on its own; only that branch's district and
  any District Officer assigned to that branch can see them.
- **Campaigns are grouped by initiator** — every campaign list is now split
  into "Head Office Campaigns," "District Campaigns," and "Branch Campaigns"
  sections instead of one flat list.
- **Comma-formatted numbers** everywhere large figures are entered or shown
  (target-setting grids, campaign creation, daily entry) — type digits, and
  they're formatted with commas once you move to the next field.
- **Campaign names** are now styled distinctly (bold, gradient) wherever they
  appear, so they stand out from the surrounding text.

## What's new in v5 — a genuine multi-campaign platform

### Campaigns can start anywhere
- **Head Office, a District, or a Branch** can each start a campaign.
  Whoever starts it sets the name, KPIs (fully custom — any name + unit +
  weight, weights must total 100%), start/end dates, optional reward, and the
  overall target for each KPI.
- The hierarchy that takes part depends on who starts it:
  - **Branch-started** → just that branch and its staff.
  - **District-started** → that district, its branches, and their staff.
  - **HO-started** → everyone: all districts, all branches, all staff.
- **Multiple campaigns run at once.** A branch might be entering data for a
  national HO campaign and its own local campaign in the same week — each
  dashboard now starts with a campaign list, and you drill into one at a time.

### Targets always cascade from the immediate level above
Whoever holds a target distributes it to the level below:
HO → District → Branch → Staff, or District → Branch → Staff, or straight to
Branch → Staff, depending on who started the campaign. Each "Set Targets"
screen shows a running sum against the parent target per KPI and tells you
clearly whether it matches — it won't block you from saving a work-in-progress,
but it won't let a mismatch pass silently either. If a branch/district hasn't
explicitly set a breakdown yet, staff/branches default to an even split so
work isn't blocked while a manager gets around to it.

### Every role can change its own password; the level above can reset it
Previously only Staff had individual logins. Now **HO, District, Branch,
Staff, and District Officer** each have their own password and a "Change
Password" button (key icon, top right of every page). The hierarchy resets
the level below: HO resets a District's password, a District resets a
Branch's or a District Officer's, a Branch resets a Staff member's — each
generates a new temporary password shown once, and the affected account must
change it on next sign-in.

### District Officers — a new audit role
A District can create **District Officer** accounts (District Officers tab)
and assign each one to specific branches. An officer signs in with
District + Name/ID + password (5th tile on the sign-in page) and sees only
their assigned branches, with pace color-coded and **branches below 35% pace
automatically flagged "Needs justification."** Officers post feedback
(general or aimed at one staff member); the branch or that staff member can
reply, building a threaded conversation. Districts see every thread from
their officers on the Feedback tab.

### Notifications
A bell icon (top right, every page) shows unread notifications: a new
campaign started, your target was set, a submission was rejected, feedback
was posted or replied to, or your password was reset. Click to mark read.

### Color-coded KPI percentages everywhere
Every dashboard now shows each KPI's pace-to-date as a colored chip:
**green above 100%, yellow 50–100%, red below 50%** — HO, District, Branch,
and Staff dashboards all use the same coding.

### Carried over from v4
- Staff accounts with manager approval (pending → approved/rejected →
  resubmit); nothing counts anywhere until approved.
- Two percentages: **Achieved** (vs. full target) and **Pace** (vs. plan to
  date) — league tables rank by Pace.
- Structured field visits, weekly/monthly/daily reports with Excel & PDF
  export.

## Testing

The full backend (campaign creation and scoping at all three initiator
levels, target cascading and validation at every level, the staff
submit/approve/reject/resubmit cycle, password self-service and the full
hierarchical reset chain, district officer creation/assignment/audit,
feedback threading and reply permissions, and notifications) was verified
with 66 automated checks against a real Postgres-compatible engine
(pg-mem) — all passing. Key screens (5-role sign-in, campaign creation with
dynamic KPI rows, the HO→District target-cascade screen with live
validation, and the district officer audit dashboard with the 35%
justification flag) were visually rendered and confirmed correct.

A further 35 automated checks cover this build's additions: the off-days /
working-day engine, cumulative daily/weekly/monthly/grand reporting (with
hand-verified math), the HO branch-campaign visibility restriction, and the
My Plan endpoint — plus a full regression pass confirming the target
cascade, approval cycle, dashboards, and district-officer/feedback system
all still work correctly. District login was re-verified via both the API
and a real sign-in flow in a browser. Visually confirmed in this build: the
off-days calendar (click-to-exclude), comma-formatting on target inputs,
grouped campaign sections, the cumulative report view, the branch's
explicit cascaded-target display, the My Plan tab, and mobile layouts for
the sign-in page and dashboards.

A final 25 automated checks cover the latest round: the new shared district
password, whole-number plan rounding, staff "My Report," and campaign
edit/delete (including permission checks confirming only the actual
initiator can edit or delete). Visually confirmed: district sign-in with
`456` in a live browser flow, the redesigned My Plan table, the edit
campaign modal (including that it correctly pre-fills existing target
values — an early version of this didn't, and was caught and fixed during
testing), the delete confirmation, the mobile hamburger menu opening and
closing correctly, and the staff My Report cumulative view.

The most recent round of changes adds 37 further automated checks: the
district login root-cause fix (deliberately simulating a district stuck on
a stale password from a "previous deployment" and confirming the new
default correctly reaches it, while a district's own chosen password and
an HO-issued reset both correctly survive a later redeploy — this is the
exact scenario that every earlier fix attempt had missed), the district
branch-picker (select-all, tick/untick, and confirming a district can't
sneak in another district's branch), the district officer's aggregated
plan/report table (hand-verified: two branches at 10% and 20% pace
correctly combine into a Total row of 15%, matching the actual and plan
sums exactly), and the district's two separate report tables with their
own Total rows. Visually confirmed in a live browser: district sign-in
with the new password, the branch picker (including the tick/untick
interaction updating the live count), the hamburger drawer's navigation
section actually switching tabs, and all three new tables rendering
correctly with real submitted data. One bug was caught and fixed during
this pass — a district's own ID was never included in its sign-in
response (only encoded in the auth token), which the new branch-picker
was the first feature to ever need directly; now fixed for all four
scoped roles.

A final round adds 57 further automated checks covering: the Sofar/Grand
math split (verified directly — a 1,000-unit target shows exactly 1,000 as
the Grand plan regardless of elapsed time, while Sofar prorates correctly);
the full hierarchical drill-down (HO into a district and a branch, District
into a branch and that branch's staff, Branch into its own staff — plus the
permission boundary that blocks a district from viewing another district's
branch); justifications correctly appearing in report completeness data
alongside genuinely missing staff; the audit log (correct entries recorded
for campaign changes, approvals, and resets, with District correctly seeing
only its own scope and Branch correctly denied access entirely); and
cross-campaign history (a past campaign's final achieved% computed
correctly, with ongoing/future campaigns correctly excluded). The "About
This Campaign" card was visually confirmed rendering all five pieces of
information (aim, time frame, overall target, reward, notes) together
correctly. As noted above, the audit log and cross-campaign history are
tested and working at the API level but do not yet have a viewer screen.

## Deploy on Render — Blueprint (recommended, one click)

1. Push this repo to GitHub, with `render.yaml` at the **top level** (next to
   `server.js` and `package.json` — not nested in a subfolder; if it ends up
   nested after upload, add `rootDir: <folder-name>` under the service in
   `render.yaml`).
2. Render dashboard → **New + → Blueprint** → connect the repo.
3. Render asks you to fill in `HO_PASSWORD`, `DISTRICT_PASSWORD`, and
   `BRANCH_PASSWORD` before deploying — **set real passwords here** rather
   than leaving them blank, so they're never sitting in your repo. Leave
   blank to use the defaults below for now; you can change them later from
   inside the app anyway (every role can change its own password once
   signed in).
4. Click **Deploy Blueprint**. Render creates the database and web service
   together, already wired — no manual `DATABASE_URL` copying.
5. First boot seeds the org chart (12 districts, 103 sample branches) and one
   sample HO campaign ("4th Dare to Serve Campaign") so the system isn't
   empty on first look.

### Default passwords (if you left the Blueprint prompts blank)
- **Head Office:** `BoA-HO-2026`
- **District:** `456` — the same simple password for every district (this was
  simplified from an earlier per-district scheme that was causing sign-in
  confusion; each district should change it after first sign-in from the
  password button in the header, and HO can reset any district's password
  at any time from then on)
- **Branch:** `BoA-Branch-2026` (shared starting password for every branch —
  each branch should change it after first sign-in; a District can reset an
  individual branch's password at any time from then on)
- **Staff** and **District Officer** accounts are always created individually
  by their manager, with a generated temporary password shown once.

## Upgrading from v4

This is a genuinely different data model (campaigns are now separate,
plural, and cascading, rather than one fixed set of KPIs). **Existing v4
staff accounts and entries will not carry over.** Recommended path: deploy
this as a **new** Render Blueprint (new service name, new database) rather
than pointing it at your existing v4 database. Once you've moved traffic
over, you can retire the old v4 service.
